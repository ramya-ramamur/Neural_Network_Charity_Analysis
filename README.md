# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by a charitable organization. Using the features in the provided dataset containing various measures on 34,000 organizations, we will analyze and classify the success of charitable donations with deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python. 

We use the following methods for the analysis:
1. Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. Optimize the Model
